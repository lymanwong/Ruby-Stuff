Summary:
42 is the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. 
This Answer was first calculated by the supercomputer Deep Thought after seven and a half million years of thought. 
This shocking answer resulted in the construction of an even larger supercomputer, named Earth, which was tasked with determining what the question was in the first place.

The Question:
The Earth was destroyed by the Vogons five minutes before its ten-million year program was due to be completed. 
One of the only two humans who had survived the destruction of Earth, namely Arthur Dent, pulls random Scrabble tiles from a bag. 
When his friend, Ford Prefect, lines up the tiles, they spell, 'What do you get when you multiply six by nine?' 
Some readers of Adams have thought that this question was the aforementioned Ultimate Question. 
After all, it is Arthur who has been led to reveal this answer; Arthur is indeed from Earth; the Earth was the giant computer built to work out exactly what the Ultimate Question was; and 'what is 6 x 9?' is a bona fide question.
