=begin
Your goal is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
=end

def array_diff(a, b)
	p a
end

p array_diff(([1,2] , [1]), [2])
# a was [1,2], b was [1], expected [2]
# array_diff([1,2,2], [1]), [2,2])
#a was [1,2,2], b was [1], expected [2,2]"
# array_diff([1,2,2], [2]), [1]) 
#"a was [1,2,2], b was [2], expected [1]"
# array_diff([1,2,2], []), [1,2,2]) 
#"a was [1,2,2], b was [], expected [1,2,2]"
# array_diff([], [1,2]), []) 
#"a was [], b was [1,2], expected []"
