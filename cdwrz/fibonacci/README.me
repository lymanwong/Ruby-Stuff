The fibonacci sequence is a sequence where you start with 0 and 1 and you add them. Then you keep adding the last two numbers to make the next number in the sequence. For example: 0,1,1,2,3,5... For this exercise your job is to finish the defined fibonacci method so that it returns all of the numbers of the fibonacci sequence that are less than or equal to the given value in an array.

Here is an example: the given value is 23, so the array would be [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21].
